Java projects done during my time in Computer Programming 2

HW2.java requires a .txt file to be inputted. There iss a sample file provided: inputSample.txt. Custom .txt files are also compatible provided the word input locations are identified with <these-brackets>.
A .txt file needs to be provided for HW4.java to run.  The frquency list and word list in the output, unfortunately, would not effectively print horizontally, together. Given enough time, I am sure this could be rectified, however, I have not felt it necessary yet.  If I change my mind it will be fixed, and I will remove this comment.
The GameCard.java and Game.java code was written by me for HW5, however the HW5.java file was provided to us by our professor, Mrs. McCauley.
StringsList.java was a class that was written for HW6 and HW6.java is a test program for StringsList.java.

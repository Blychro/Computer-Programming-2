# Computer-Programming-2
Java projects done during my time in Computer Programming 2

HW2.java requires a .txt file to be inputted. There iss a sample file provided: inputSample.txt. Custom .txt files are also compatible provided the word input locations are identified with <these-brackets>.
A .txt file needs to be provided for HW4.java to run.  The frquency list and word list in the output, unfortunately, would not effectively print horizontally, together. Given enough time, I am sure this could be rectified, however, I have not felt it necessary yet.  If I change my mind it will be fixed, and I will remove this comment.
The GameCard.java and Game.java code was written by me for HW5, however the HW5.java file was provided to us by our professor, Mrs. McCauley.
StringsList.java was a class that was written for HW6 and HW6.java is a test program for StringsList.java.
HW7.java used a StringsList.java provided by my professor not in this folder.  This should not cause any issues because the two should be functionally identical. If any problem occurs and I am aware of the error I will correct it.
HW8.java, OrderedList.java, and LengthOrderedList.java were all written by me for HW8. AbstractStringsList.java, UnorderedStringList.java, StringDuplicateException.java and StringNotFoundException.java were all provided by our professor, Mrs.McCauley and necessary for it to run.  HW8.java is simply test cases for the OrderedList.java and LengthOrderedList.java classes
Lab5_1_TBM.java was a test case for NumberOutOfRangeException.java and Lab5_2_TBM.java requires an input form inFile.txt
